# IndySCCA Website Project
IndySCCA.org Website Project

This repository is a placeholder for a possible website replacement project if it is deemed that a replacement would be beneficial to the club.

A Google Forms document has been prepared for club members to voice their opinion on what features theywould like to see with a replacement website. That document will dictate if a replacement is wanted and will influence the proposal document in this repository. Please go to the following link to submit your ideas.
